
This directory includes default web and error pages which are included in the default page of nginx.

You can replace this files if you want other default pages on your web server.
Please do not remove this pages as they will be recreated on a container restart.

If you add additional pages here, they will be available on the default web page.
For custom web pages you will probably need to include them with different directives you will probably need to add them inside the server directive.
