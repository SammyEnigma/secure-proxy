# This configuration contains the default modsecurity configuration

# It is available in all sites by default as this is already loaded in the http directive.
# If you do not want this configuration to be active, we recommend to modify the http directive in your nginx.conf file.
# A change on the http directive affects all pages so be carefull with this and test it on a seperate instance first.
# To change this you will need to remove the line "include /config/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;" from nginx.conf.
# Make sure to add all required files manually to the http directive before doing this or you break the functionality of all pages.
# You can add the individual files by adding the following to your nginx.conf file. 
# Make sure to replace "filename.conf" with the realname and remove "#" at the beginning to make this active.

# Examples to add only individual configs to the http directive
# include /config/nginx/conf.d/filename.conf;
