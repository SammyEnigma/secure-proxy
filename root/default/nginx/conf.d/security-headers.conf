# it will be available in all sites if you include one of the following two examples inside your server block
# The first example is the best as it loads all "*.conf" files from the directory

# Make sure to remove the leading "#" from the specific line

# Examples for server block
# include /config/nginx/sites-conf.d/*.conf;
# include /config/nginx/sites-conf.d/filename.conf;
