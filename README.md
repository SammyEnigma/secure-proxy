# Secure-Proxy

Secure-Proxy based on nginx with integrated web application firewall, Let's Encrypt, fail2ban, ClamAV upload scan and a lot more ðŸ˜‰. It is designed as a pure reverse proxy which faces to the public internet. It can also server static files which you place inside the foler `/config/www`. It has an integrated Openresty Lua support. You can also use this internally but you will not be able to use Let's Encrypt as this requires a http challenge at the moment. The proxy server is designed to secure your application and the data you host on them. It comes with serval well known open source security features like fail2ban ip blocking, ClamAV, etc.

# Documentation

There is no documentation at the moment, it will come soon. If you want to use it have a look at the docker compose file below and the list of available settings. The configuration of your reverse proxies can be configured within the folder `/config/nginx/sites-available`. Other settings are also located in `/config`. 

### Docker settings:
All configuration files are stored in `/config`. Therefore it is recommended to make this folder persistent and mount it with an docker volume or local path. The proxy instance is listening on port `80` and `443`. You need to map both ports and also configure port forwarding for both ports. There is no security issue if you open port 80 as there is an immediate redirect to port 443. Port 80 is only required for the initial connect of the Let's Encrypt http challenge.

#### General docker parameter
- `-p 80:80`
- `-p 443:443`
- `-v /local_path:/config`

#### Environment variables

| Name               | Required      | Description       |
| :---               |    :----:     | :---              |
| TZ                 | yes           | Set your [timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for logs, cron jobs and syncs |
| PUID               | no            | User id to use in case of permission issues |
| PGID               | no            | Group id of the user provided in PUID in case of permission issues |
| DOMAIN             | yes           | Main domain to use, will be the first domain on the Let's Encrypt certificate (e.g. "example.com") |
| SUBDOMAINS         | no            | Subdomains for this certificate, only provide the subdomains seperated by space (e.g. "community" if you want "community.example.com") |
| OTHER_DOMAINS      | no            | Other domains that should be included in the certificate, seperate them by a space (e.g. "mail.example2.com smtp.example2.com")  |
| EMAIL              | recommended   | Email address to use for the certificate. Not needed, but recommended for a proper certificate |
| STAGING            | yes           | Set to `true` for testing for higher rate limits. For production use `false` to get a valid certificate which is trusted by web browsers |
| SMTP_SERVER        | no            | Smtp server and port  for email notifications (e.g. "smtp.example.com:587" |
| SMTP_SENDER_MAIL   | no            | Smtp sender address for outgoing mails. Required if you provide the parameter `SMTP_SERVER` |
| SMTP_SENDER_NAME   | no            | Smtp sender name to display on outgoing mails. Required if you provide the parameter `SMTP_SERVER` |
| SMTP_RECEIVER      | no            | Smtp mail receiver for your notifiations. Required if you provide the parameter `SMTP_SERVER` |
| SMTP_PASSWORD      | no            | Smtp account password for outgoing mails. Required if you provide the parameter `SMTP_SERVER` and don't provide the `SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE`parameter |
| SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE | no            | Smtp account password which can be linked from a file or an docker secret. It is recommended to use this instead of `SMTP_PASSWORD` as the password is not written in cleartext inside the docker file. Required if you provide the parameter `SMTP_SERVER` and dont provide `SMTP_PASSWORD` |
