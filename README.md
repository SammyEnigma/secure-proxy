# Secure-Proxy

Secure-Proxy based on nginx with integrated web application firewall, Let's Encrypt, fail2ban, ClamAV upload scan and a lot more ðŸ˜‰. It is designed as a pure reverse proxy which faces to the public internet. It can also server static files which you place inside the foler `/config/www`. It has an integrated Openresty Lua support. You can also use this internally but you will not be able to use Let's Encrypt as this requires a http challenge at the moment. The proxy server is designed to secure your application and the data you host on them. It comes with serval well known open source security features like fail2ban ip blocking, ClamAV, etc.

# Documentation

There is no documentation at the moment, it will come soon. If you want to use it have a look at the docker compose file below and the list of available settings. The configuration of your reverse proxies can be configured within the folder `/config/nginx/sites-available`. Other settings are also located in `/config`. 

### Docker settings:
All configuration files are stored in `/config`. Therefore it is recommended to make this folder persistent and mount it with an docker volume or local path. The proxy instance is listening on port `80` and `443`. You need to map both ports and also configure port forwarding for both ports. There is no security issue if you open port 80 as there is an immediate redirect to port 443. Port 80 is only required for the initial connect of the Let's Encrypt http challenge.

#### General docker parameter
- `-p 80:80`
- `-p 443:443`
- `-v /local_path:/config`

| CERTBOT_STAGING       | yes         | Set to `true` for testing. For production use `false` to get a valid certificate which is trusted by web browsers |
| CLAMAV_SYSTEM_SCAN    | no          | Enables or disables the ClamAV file system scan. Values are `enabled` and `disabled`. Default is `enabled` |
